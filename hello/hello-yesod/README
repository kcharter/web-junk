A "hello world" application using the Yesod web framework. A few
notes:

- the original yesod version is 0.9.4.1

- I used 'yesod init' to generate the project, and selected a minimal
  project with no database and no authentication.

- under this version of yesod, the auto-generated project does not in
  fact compile. In module 'Application', there are conflicts between
  the identifiers 'AppConfig' and 'appPort' imported from modules
  'Foundation' and 'Settings'.

  The problem arises because 'Foundation' re-exports module
  'Settings', but both are imported in 'Application'. The compilation
  problem is fixed by simply modifying 'Application' to use the more
  explicit 'Settings.AppConfig' and 'Settings.appPort'.

  I suspect that the problems are just minor bugs that will be fixed
  for Yesod 0.10. There are also a number of deprecation warnings when
  compiling the generated 'main' module.

- I still have trouble figuring out how to properly use 'cabal-dev'
  with the scaffolded Yesod app.

  - using 'cabal-dev/bin/yesod --dev configure' doesn't seem to work
    properly, since it complains about 'cmdargs' and 'yesod-static'
    being missing dependencies. I ended up using 'cabal-dev install'
    in order to get the dependencies installed, even though this ends
    up dropping the compiled binary for the project in the 'cabal-dev'
    directory.

  - after that, using 'cabal-dev/bin/yesod --dev devel' works alright.

- The 'devel' server has the annoying habit of screwing up the
  terminal settings. I find that I need to do 'stty sane' after the
  devel server exits.

- When you edit a hamlet template in the 'hamlet' directory, the
  'yesod devel' does not automatically pick up the change. Do get the
  devel server to notice the change, you have to touch a Haskell
  module that loads the template -- i.e. generally a handler for the
  corresponding page. I don't think this is mentioned in the Yesod
  book, but it is mentioned in response to a call for Yesod
  peeves. See, for example
  http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.yesod/1128

- update on using cabal-dev: you can do this:

  - 'cabal-dev configure' to find out the missing dependencies

  - 'cabal-dev install' to install the missing dependencies; for this
    'hello-world' example, this includes just 'cmdargs' and
    'yesod-static'.

  - 'cabal-dev configure' to complete the configuration

  - 'cabal-dev/bin/yesod --dev devel' to compile and run the 'devel'
    version of the server.

  - it's a little inconsistent that 'yesod' doesn't provide 'clean'
    and 'configure' commands, but it's not a huge wart to live with
