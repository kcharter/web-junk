This is the simple by-hand 'hello world' application used as an
example in the Yesod book. There is a lot less code here than with a
scaffolded project, and it's useful for following the book.

I've used a Makefile rather than a cabal file because for this example
it's sufficient and a lot shorter. Since I'm using cabal-dev, I have
to give a -package-conf argument to GHC so it can find the packages.

Compiling 'helloworld.hs' doesn't take too long, but linking the
application takes quite a while. I hope the book shows a way to speed
up the edit-compile-test cycle; otherwise, prototyping an idea in
yesod will be a bit sluggish.
